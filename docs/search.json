    "text": "Our Recommendations\nIf you are a small-to-moderate donor, you’ll probably be able to generate the maximum gift to us by making just one donation. But keep in mind:\n\nLook for a time-window with the highest matching-rate (e.g., $1 for every dollar given is better than $0.50 for every dollar given).\nLook also for high maximum matches. For example, suppose you plan to give $150 and you have a choice between two funds, both of which match at the same rate but Fund A does not match gift amounts $100 whereas fund B matches gift amounts up to $200, then you’ll generate more money for us by working with Fund B.)\n\nIf you are a “heavy-hitter”, then you should consider splitting your gift over several time-windows in order to leverage multiple matching opportunities.\nWe can help you split your gift! Just enter your total gift below:\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember: Within each time-window, try to give as early as possible, before the fund’s matching-pool is exceeded!"
