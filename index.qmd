## The Good Giving Challenge:  How It Works

During the course of the Giving Challenge there are certain periods of time during which your gift can be matched by a donor fund.

The funds are described below.  As you can see, the funds differ in how much they will match, the upper limit on how much they will match any gift, and their total "pool" of money available to match gifts.


```{=html}
<ul id="matchers">

</ul>
```

Given the differences between the funds, you are probably wondering:

>*How should I give so as to maximize the amount that M'Power Drum receives?*

This site aims to help you with your question!

## Our Recommendations

If you are a small-to-moderate donor, you'll probably be able to generate the maximum gift to us by making just one donation.  But keep in mind:

* Look for a time-window with the highest matching-rate (e.g., $1 for every dollar given is better than $0.50 for every dollar given).
* Look also for high maximum matches.  For example, suppose you plan to give $150 and you have a choice between two funds, both of which match at the same rate but Fund A does not match gift amounts $100 whereas fund B matches gift amounts up to $200, then you'll generate more money for us by working with Fund B.)

If you are a "heavy-hitter", then you should consider splitting your gift over several time-windows in order to leverage multiple matching opportunities.

We can help you split your gift!  Just enter your total gift below:

```{=html}
<input id="optimize-input" type="number" value="1000">
<br>
<br>
```

Here is one way to maximize our gift with the money you plan to donate:

```{=html}
<div id="optimize-output"></div>
```

**Remember**:  Within each time-window, try to give as early as possible, before the fund's matching-pool is exceeded!

## Do-It-Yourself Option

If you have a special interest in engaging with some of the funds but are still interested in maximizing the money we get from your gift, you can experiment with the table below:

```{=html}
<table id="diy" class="table table-bordered table-hover">

</table>
```
