<em style="font-size: 120%">Empowering Youth, Building Community, Honoring Culture</em>

Mâ€™Power Rhythm is a nonprofit music education organization, formed in 2023, focused on empowering youth, building community, and honoring culture through the medium of ensemble African drumming. We invite youth ages 8-18 from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds to join us in our joyful and expert-led musical environments and performances. 

Group drumming is not only a potent approach to percussion,  but also fertile ground for learning teamwork, experiencing belonging, and expressing emotions and creativity. 

While playing the rhythms of cultures from throughout the African diaspora, our students develop discipline, confidence and leadership.
